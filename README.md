## Wildcat Samples
This repository is a collection of sample programs using the Wildcat storage engine.

### Contribute a sample program
If you have a sample program in GO or in C using interop feel free to create a PR.  The PR should read as wc_sample1 in this directory, thus should include
- Language of sample
- Explaination of the sample program
- Version of Wildcat used


> [!NOTE]
> Directories should use prefix wc_sample followed by monotonically increasing numbers (wc_sample1, wc_sample2, wc_sample3, etc.)
